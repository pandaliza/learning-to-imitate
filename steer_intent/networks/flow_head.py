"""WSM-v2 head: predict 3D flow / tracks from the workspace latent ``w_t`` (DynaFLIP target).

Decodes ``w_t`` into future 3D point tracks for a set of query points — the DynaFLIP target (grid
tracks + depth/pose + unprojection with camera motion canceled). This is the *second* decoder that
sits alongside the keyframe-patch head in WSM v2. Governed by
internal_planning_and_todos/04_wsm_roadmap.md ("R3 = E2 — 3D flow (WSM v2)" + "3D-flow / track head").

TODO
----
- [ ] Define the query-point parameterization (grid seeds) and the horizon T of predicted tracks.
- [ ] Implement the decoder ``w_t`` (+ query coords) -> (B, num_tracks, T, 3) world-frame tracks.
- [ ] Define the target format (camera-motion-canceled 3D tracks) + the loss (e.g. masked endpoint L2).
- [ ] Expose track endpoint error / visibility metrics for train/val.
